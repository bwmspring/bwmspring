# BWM — Web3 / Backend Engineer

### Hi there 👋 I'm BWM

I'm a backend engineer focused on Web3 and high-performance systems. I combine on-chain data, real-time streaming, and large language models to build readable, low-latency indexing and delivery services.

## 🛠 Skills

- **Core languages**: Go, Rust, TypeScript
- **Blockchain / Web3**: EVM, go-ethereum (Geth), JSON-RPC, Layer-2 protocols such as Arbitrum and Base
- **AI / LLMs**: OpenAI (GPT family), Qwen, Dify workflows, prompt engineering
- **Databases & Caching**: PostgreSQL, Redis (Pub/Sub, caching)
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Prometheus
- **Real-time & Data Streams**: WebSocket, Moralis Streams, webhook handling

## 📁 Projects & Work

- **Indexing & Real-time Feed** — parsing logs/events into human-readable feeds, supporting multi-chain aggregation and AI-powered summaries

## 🔭 Currently

- Improving the backend indexing layer and database schema to ensure consistency and idempotency under high concurrency.
- Integrating LLMs to semantically interpret transactions and generate concise summaries.
